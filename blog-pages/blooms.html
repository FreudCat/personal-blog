        <h1 class="center-text">Case-Based Learning: Bloom's Taxonomy</h1>
      </header>

      <div id="purpose">
        <p><b>Purpose: </b>The College of Medicine uses case-based learning in conjunction with large and small group lectures as part of its curriculum. Initially, I was a case-based learning small group facilitator. I later joined the editorial board, and I am now part of the case-writing team. The following excerpt will focus on the creation of learning objectives for a case on which I am currently working.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <h2 class="center-text">Background</h2>
        <p>The student body consists of first-year medical students who have completed the prerequisite scientific courses. However, work and life experience varies greatly, as is common among adult learners. Some students have worked in clinics for years, while others have no clinical experience.</p>
        <div class="taxonomy">
          <h2>Remember</h2>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome:</b> Recall the definition of hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperkalemia.</p>
          <p><b>Domain:</b> Cognitive</p>
          <p><b>Rationale:</b>Ensure that students recall basic, foundational terminology from lecture and reading. This allows all students to have the same foundation on which to build, regardless of their prior experience with the topic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="taxonomy">
          <h2>Understand</h2>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome:</b> Explain the pathophysiologic processes behind each electrolyte abnormality.</p>
          <p><b>Domain:</b> Cognitive</p>
          <p><b>Rationale: </b>This helps establish a foundation for all students and encourages students to understand the steps in which these processes occur. Later, students can determine where intervention can be applied.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="taxonomy">
          <h2>Apply</h2>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome:</b> Show how the RAA system normally responds to fluid imbalance, which leads to changes in sodium and potassium.</p>
          <p><b>Domain:</b> Cognitive</p>
          <p><b>Rationale: </b>The students should understand how the healthy body maintains homeostasis. This will help them better characterize deviations that occur due to disease or medications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="taxonomy">
          <h2>Analyze</h2>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome:</b> Analyze and discuss how our patient’s disease led to the abnormalities. Determine which clinical signs caused the abnormalities and which occurred because of the abnormalities.</p>
          <p><b>Domain:</b> Cognitive and Affective</p>
          <p><b>Rationale: </b>Here, I anchor the foundational science to a clinical application. This will help students understand and interpret the information in a relevant setting, hopefully improving retention. As students discuss with their peers, they should listen respectfully to their peers’ opinions and explanations. They should encourage each other to contribute thoughtfully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="taxonomy">
          <h2>Evaluate</h2>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome:</b> Rank our patient’s clinical signs from most urgent to least urgent and explain the rationale.</p>
          <p><b>Domain:</b> Cognitive and Affective</p>
          <p><b>Rationale: </b>The students should understand how ongoing fluid imbalances may negatively impact the patient, and thus determine how the symptoms should be addressed. They should explain and justify their decisions. If they disagree with peers, they should respond respectfully and appropriately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="taxonomy">
          <h2>Create</h2>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome:</b> Create a treatment protocol for your patient and explain how this will regain electrolyte and acid/base balance.</p>
          <p><b>Domain:</b> Cognitive and Affective</p>
          <p><b>Rationale: </b>Students should now utilize all the information they learned to create an appropriate treatment protocol that addresses the main topic of the week: electrolyte and acid/base abnormalities. They should understand why and how the treatment protocol works. They may find that there are many appropriate treatment protocols, and they should be able to justify their decisions and respectfully critique their peers’ protocols. Students should be able to take criticism of their own protocols gracefully.</p>
