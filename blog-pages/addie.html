        <p class="center-text"><b>Purpose: </b>This program’s primary purpose is to introduce students to healthcare careers via case-based learning sessions and hands-on engagement. In addition, we aim to address the disparity in access to healthcare in Washington’s rural communities. Our hope is to increase the number of students interested in pursuing a health degree, especially students with a desire to return to underserved communities to practice healthcare.</p>

        <h2 class="center-text">Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Audience: Begins with students in 7th grade and continues following them through 9th grade.</li>
          <li>Reading Level: Some students are reading at a 2nd-grade or 3rd-grade level. <em>Will need to utilize appropriate and correct medical and scientific terminology while providing definitions and foundations for students who read at a lower level.</em></li>
          <li>Experience: No prior experience with case-based learning sessions and little-to-no experience with STEM-oriented labs. <em>Will need to explain the purpose of this style of learning and to establish expectations for students in case-based learning sessions.</em></li>
          <li>Stakeholders: Students and their families, school principals and teachers, outreach program grant funders, WSU and EWU faculty.</li>
